## Initial MVP idea:
​
Detail plans and scope of project here....
​
<p>  We initially thought about what could set our application apart from other finance apps, and we came up with the idea of producing motivational/ funny messages based on whether the user can afford a purchase or not. We then discussed which API we would use and how this would allow the user to track spending. We started to concider the layout of the different pages of the application and decided, based upon early wireframes, that we would have a seperate page for returing users to login as well as for new users to create an account. We decided on an initial color scheme and elements of different pages and discussed how we would implement them </p>
